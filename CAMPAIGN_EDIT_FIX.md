# 🔧 Campaign Edit Data Reset Fix

## 🔍 **Problem Identified**

When editing a campaign and saving changes, all campaign data was being reset including:
- **Email send statistics** (showing 0 emails sent)
- **Campaign performance data** (open rates, delivery stats)
- **Email sequence relationships** (breaking links to sent emails)

## ✅ **What I Fixed**

### **1. Preserved Email Sequence IDs** ✅
- **Before**: Deleted and recreated all email sequences (breaking relationships)
- **After**: Updates existing sequences in place, preserving IDs and relationships

### **2. Maintained Email Send Data** ✅
- **Before**: Breaking the link between email_sends and email_sequences
- **After**: Preserving the relationship so statistics remain intact

### **3. Added Scheduled Date/Time Support** ✅
- **Before**: Not loading scheduled_date and scheduled_time from database
- **After**: Properly loading and saving scheduled dates and times

### **4. Smart Update Logic** ✅
- **Before**: Always deleting and recreating everything
- **After**: Only updating what changed, preserving existing data

## 🚀 **How the Fix Works**

### **Before (Broken)**:
```typescript
// This was breaking everything!
await supabase
  .from('email_sequences')
  .delete()
  .eq('campaign_id', campaignId);

await supabase
  .from('email_sequences')
  .insert(newSequenceData);
```

### **After (Fixed)**:
```typescript
// This preserves existing data!
const existingSequences = await supabase
  .from('email_sequences')
  .select('*')
  .eq('campaign_id', campaignId);

// Update existing sequences or create new ones
for (let i = 0; i < newSequence.length; i++) {
  if (existingSequence) {
    // Update in place - preserves ID and relationships
    await supabase
      .from('email_sequences')
      .update(sequenceData)
      .eq('id', existingSequence.id);
  } else {
    // Only create new ones if needed
    await supabase
      .from('email_sequences')
      .insert(sequenceData);
  }
}
```

## 🧪 **Testing the Fix**

### **Test 1: Edit Campaign Without Data Loss**
1. **Create a campaign** and send some emails
2. **Check dashboard** - should show emails sent/delivered
3. **Edit the campaign** (change name, description, or email content)
4. **Save changes**
5. **Return to dashboard** - statistics should still be there!

### **Test 2: Edit Email Sequences**
1. **Create campaign** with follow-up emails
2. **Send some emails** from the campaign
3. **Edit the email sequences** (change subject, body, timing)
4. **Save changes**
5. **Check dashboard** - email statistics should be preserved

### **Test 3: Add/Remove Email Steps**
1. **Create campaign** with 2 email steps
2. **Send emails** from the campaign
3. **Edit campaign** and add a 3rd email step
4. **Save changes**
5. **Check dashboard** - existing email data should be preserved

## 📊 **What You'll See Now**

### **Before (Broken)**:
- Edit campaign → Save → Dashboard shows 0 emails sent
- All statistics reset to zero
- Campaign appears as if no emails were ever sent

### **After (Fixed)**:
- Edit campaign → Save → Dashboard shows correct statistics
- Email send data preserved
- Campaign performance data maintained
- Only the edited fields change, everything else stays the same
