# ðŸ“§ Compose Email Update - Custom Sender Email

## âœ… **What Changed**

I've updated the Compose Email component to allow you to **write your own email address** in the "From" field instead of being limited to choosing from configured sender accounts.

## ðŸŽ¯ **New Features**

### **1. Custom Sender Email Input** âœ…
- **Text input field** instead of dropdown
- **Enter any email address** you want to send from
- **Real-time validation** of email format
- **Helper text** explaining the feature

### **2. Quick Account Selection** âœ…
- **Mail icon button** next to the input field
- **One-click fill** with your first configured account
- **Convenient shortcut** for using configured accounts

### **3. Enhanced Validation** âœ…
- **Validates sender email** format before sending
- **Clear error messages** for invalid emails
- **Prevents sending** with invalid sender addresses

## ðŸš€ **How It Works Now**

### **Before (Limited):**
- Had to choose from dropdown of configured accounts
- Could only send from pre-configured sender accounts
- Limited flexibility in sender selection

### **After (Flexible):**
- **Type any email address** you want in the "From" field
- **Send from any email** address you have access to
- **Quick fill option** for configured accounts
- **Full control** over sender email address

## ðŸŽ¨ **Interface Changes**

### **From Field:**
- **Input field** with placeholder "your-email@example.com"
- **Mail icon button** for quick account selection
- **Helper text** explaining the feature
- **Real-time validation** feedback

### **Validation:**
